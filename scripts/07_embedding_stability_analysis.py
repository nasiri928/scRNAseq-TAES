Title: Run-to-Run Stability Analysis of UMAP/t-SNE Embeddings in scRNA-seq Data

Description:
------------
This script evaluates the stability (robustness) of nonlinear embeddings such as UMAP or t-SNE 
when applied to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

Due to the stochastic nature of these dimensionality reduction techniques, their outputs may vary 
significantly across different runs with different random seeds. This can affect downstream analysis 
such as trajectory inference or clustering.

To assess stability, the script does the following for each dataset:
1. Applies a preprocessing pipeline (filtering, normalization, PCA, neighbors).
2. Computes the chosen embedding (UMAP or t-SNE) multiple times (`n_runs`) with different random seeds.
3. For each pair of embedding runs, computes pairwise distances and calculates the Spearman correlation 
   between distance vectors.
4. Reports the **mean** and **standard deviation** of these Spearman correlations as a measure of stability.

Higher mean correlation and lower standard deviation indicate more stable (reproducible) embeddings.

Usage:
------
- Adjust `embedding_method` to `"umap"` or `"tsne"`.
- Adjust the dataset paths in the `datasets` dictionary.
- Run the script to print out stability scores for each dataset.
- Use this information to select more stable embedding techniques for trajectory inference or visualization.
