"""
Title: PCA Variance Analysis for scRNA-seq Datasets

Description:
------------
This script performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
dataset and prints the explained variance ratio for each principal component, along with the
cumulative explained variance.

This information helps determine how many principal components (PCs) are sufficient to capture
the majority of the variability in the data before applying dimensionality reduction or clustering methods.

The processing steps include:
1. Standard preprocessing: filtering, normalization, log transformation, selection of highly variable genes,
   and scaling.
2. PCA with up to `max_pcs` components.
3. Reporting of:
    - The individual explained variance ratio for each PC.
    - The cumulative variance explained up to each PC.

Usage:
------
- Set the correct path to your `.h5ad` dataset file.
- Run the script to print variance ratios and help determine a suitable number of PCs to retain.

Typical application includes deciding how many dimensions to retain for methods like UMAP, t-SNE,
neighborhood graph construction, or pseudotime inference.
